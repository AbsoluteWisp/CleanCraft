CleanCraft Version 2
====================
*This release of CleanCraft is made for Minecraft 1.17.*  
*Older versions may be broken and newer ones may have incomplete textures*. 

Credits
-------
This pack is made by **extensely modifying** a **base resource pack**.  
The base resource pack is a **[Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/)** build, with stock Minecraft textures added in for ease of editing.  
**All edits** are done **by me** - *Duch5 / Adam*

Project Info
------------
**CleanCraft** is a one-man project with one goal: to make Minecraft's UI more **modern and simplistic**.  
Because of that, there's **not much done in block and item textures**, but the **UI** is pretty much **redone**.

Features
--------
- Dark UI with white text
